<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
Thank  you for taking the time to consider volunteering in a Microsoft Corporation research project.  This form explains what would happen if you join this research project. Please read it carefully and take as much time as you need. Ask the study team about anything that is not clear.  You can ask questions about the study any time.<br>
Participation in this study is voluntary and you will not be penalized if you decide not to take part in the study or if you quit the study later. <br>
<br>
<h2>TITLE OF RESEARCH PROJECT</h2>
<b>Adaptive Testing of NLP models</b><br>
<i>Principal Investigator:</i><br>
Marco Tulio Ribeiro, Scott Lundberg<br>
<br>

<h2>PURPOSE</h2>
The purpose of this project is to compare different methodologies for testing natural language processing models.<br>
<br>

<h2>PROCEDURES</h2>
During this project, the following will happen: we will give you access to a NLP model and ask you to engage in ‘red teaming’: coming up with input/output pairs that cause the model to fail in specific ways. You will have access to interactive visualizations and assistants that will suggest ‘test cases’. At the end of the study, you will be asked to evaluate whether the tools provided are helpful. The expected duration of the experiment 40 minutes. You will work on your own computer, and you will need access to the internet.<br>
Microsoft may document and collect information about your participation by how you interact with the visualization. Researchers will have access to the examples you create, as well as your visualization assessments, which may be mentioned in a research paper (either in aggregate or individual test examples) or published as supplementary material.
Approximately 10-50 participants will be involved in this study.<br>
<br>

<h2>PERSONAL INFORMATION AND CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>

<ul>
<li>Microsoft Research is ultimately responsible for determining the purposes and uses of your personal information. <br>
<br>
<b>Personal information we collect.</b>   During the study we may collect personal information about you such as email, occupation, race, religion, and political affiliation.  

<li>How we use personal information.  Your email will only be used to schedule the study, send you the study instructions, and for compensation purposes. It will be deleted in at most 30 days. Your occupation and other personal information will be aggregated with other participants and used when describing the user study in a research paper (e.g. X participants were software engineers, X were students, etc), and when aggregating results (e.g. people from organization X found bugs of type Y). Your personal information will not be linked to your user study session.

<li>How we store and share your personal information.  Your name and other personal information will not be on the study information we receive about you or from you; this study information will be identified by a code. The key to the code will be kept separate from your personal and study information, which will be kept in a secured, limited access location.<br>
<br>
Aside from the researchers of this study, your personal information will not be shared with anyone. The data we collect during the study (i.e. your interaction with the model) may be shared with the research community outside of Microsoft, with no identifying information about you

<li>Your personal information (email) will be stored for at most 30 days. The data we collect during the study will be stored indefinitely.

<li>How you can access and control your personal information.  If you wish to review or copy any personal information you provided during the study, or if you want us to delete or correct any such data, email your request to the research team at: marcotcr@microsoft.com.  

<li>For additional information or concerns about how Microsoft handles your personal information, please see the <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839">Microsoft Privacy Statement</a>. For Employees, External Staff and Candidates please use the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=518021">Microsoft Data Privacy Notice</a>.

<h2>MICROSOFT AND CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>
The research project and information you learn by participating in the project is confidential to Microsoft.  Sharing this confidential information with people other than those we’ve identified above could negatively affect the scientific integrity of the research study and could even make it more difficult for Microsoft to develop new products based on the information obtained in this study. It is therefore important that you do not talk about the project outside of the study team (unless you are legally required to do so by a court or other government order).  This does not apply if the information is general public knowledge or if you have a legal right to share the information. <br>
<br>
<h2>BENEFITS AND RISKS</h2>
<b>Benefits:</b>  There are no direct benefits to you that might reasonably be expected as a result of being in this study. The research team expects to learn the impact of different red-teaming strategies from the results of this research, as well as any public benefit that may come these Research Results being shared with the greater scientific community.<br>
<br>
<b>Risks:</b>  During your participation, you may be exposed to strong language in automatically generated suggestions of test cases, including curse words, profanity, remarks that propagate harmful stereotypes, etc.  <b>If you are uncomfortable, you are free to stop your participation at any time.</b> Other than this, there are no anticipated, foreseeable risks or discomforts to you as a result of being in this study.<br>
<br>

<h2>PAYMENT FOR PARTICIPATION</h2>
You will receive a gift card after completing the entire study.<br>
Your data may be used to make new products, tests or findings.  These may have value and may be developed and owned by Microsoft and/or others.  If this happens, there are no plans to pay you. <br>
<br>
<h2>PARTICIPATION </h2>
Taking part in research is always a choice. If you decide to be in the study, you can change your mind at any time without affecting any rights including payment to which you would otherwise be entitled. If you decide to withdraw, you should contact the person in charge of this study, and also inform that person if you would like your personal information removed as well. <br>
Microsoft or the person in charge of this study may discontinue the study or your individual participation in the study at any time without your consent for reasons including:
<ul>
<li>your failure to follow directions
<li>it is discovered that you do not meet study requirements 
<li>it is in your best interest medically 
<li>the study is canceled
<li>administrative reasons 
</ul>
If you leave the study, the study staff will still be able to use your information that they have already collected, however, you have the right to ask for it to be removed when you leave. <br>
<br>

Significant new findings that develop during the course of this study that might impact your willingness to be in this study will be given to you. <br>
