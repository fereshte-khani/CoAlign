This is the code for https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12219

For short summary of the work check this [blog post](https://medium.com/@fereshtekhani/collaborative-development-of-nlp-models-e2b0a8a2b0f)


We implemented our GUI using the GUI from early version of [AdaTest](https://github.com/microsoft/adatest). 


In the main directory install coalign and in adatest directory install the earlier version of adatest. 

pip install -e . 

and the run the coalign_code.py for the GUI to show up.
