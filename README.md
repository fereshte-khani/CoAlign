This is the code for https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12219

For short summary of the work check this [blog post](https://medium.com/@fereshtekhani/collaborative-development-of-nlp-models-e2b0a8a2b0f)


We implemented our GUI using the GUI from early version of [AdaTest](https://github.com/microsoft/adatest). 


## installation
in the main directory install coalign and in adatest directory install the earlier version of adatest. 

pip install -e . 
cd ../adatest
pip install -e .

There are two main programs
1. for running coalign on the web (Fig 2)
2. for running coalign with unlabeled data (Fig 4). 

# Running interactive coalign

run the coalign_code.py a GUI like this will show up:
